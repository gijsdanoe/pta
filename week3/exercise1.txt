Exercise 1

1a. 6 (child, wife (2x), children, mother, father)
1b. 2 (disease, insanity)
1c. 4 (mathematician, mathematics (2x), mathematical)

3. The top 6:
1 car-automobile (1.0)
2 coast-shore (0.5)
3 monk-slave (0.2)
4 moon-string (0.11)
5 food-fruit (0.09)
6 journey-car (0.05)

Our ranking is different than Miller and Charles'. Our top two are the same, however their last two are our number 3 and 4 and our last two are theirs. This is very interesting because we personally think food and fruit and journey and car are closer to each other than monk and slave and moon and string.
