5: I chose every odd numbered case here to check. The results were correct.

6: it didnt happen that a word was assigned to multiple senses in the same article, I am not sure if the context matters. 

7: Yes

8: I could use a bigger database, a script that automatically accumulates data like this for a large number of random wiki page.
