The 5 most frequest significant (there was a lot of punctuation) POS bigrams:
('MD', 'VB')
('EX', 'VBZ')
('NNPS', 'POS')
('RBS', 'JJ')
('TO', 'VB')

Some are interesting but not as surprising because in our language and grammar, some POS tags go together all the time, such as the first one, a model auxiliary and a base verb (should have) and an adverb and an adjective (really big). The most surprising one is the third one, a plural proper noun and a possesive ending, while these do go together, you donÂ´t see them that often.

They do differ from the raw collocations because obviously the POS tags can mean a lot of different words, while the raw collocations only represent that bigram only.

I think this data can be used to understand our language and/or grammar better, and could also be useful to make texts yourself automatically.
